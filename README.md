Build your own opening repertoire. Play against engine moves with adjusted levels. Play until eval drops below -2 for you. Hold on to complete challenges. Track your progress for overall improvement.

All moves are saved, in the opening, you can view and select from your top opening lines or make a novelty move, or let the engine pick the best move for you. Playable moves that doesn't drop below -2 will further be added to your opening repertoire.

On engine's turn, you have to select what type of move engine should make. To further expand your opening repertoire, you can ask for engine to play a novelty move, that can be either a weak move, or a blunder, or a top move decided by your choosing.

The challenges will incentivize your play. Each challenge belongs to a specific opening and is recorded separately for every opening. Each challenge also have 1 to 3 stars. 1 star for selecting a blunder move for engine. 2 star for selecting a weak move for engine. 3 star for selecting only top moves.

When it's your turn, there are 3 types of hint's you can use. One hint will tell you a piece to move. Second hint will tell you the top engine move. Third hint will tell you the weakest engine move that doesn't drop below -2 for you. Hint's will put your playout in experiment mode, and challenges won't be eligible for.

You can ask for 3 takebacks, which will also put your playout in experiment mode.
